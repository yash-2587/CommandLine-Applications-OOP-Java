# 🎯 Java CLI Project Collection

This repository contains Java-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) projects built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Each project demonstrates a specific real-life system simulation with dedicated classes, interfaces, and user roles.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🦁 [Zootopia – A Zoo Management System]
A role-based CLI application where **Admins** can manage attractions, animals, and events, while **Visitors** can explore the zoo, purchase memberships, and leave feedback. Built using **Java + Maven** in **IntelliJ**.

### 2. 📚 [Library/Zoo CLI Management System]  
A terminal-based management system using Java that simulates a real-world library/zoo. Incorporates user roles, object-oriented design, and robust input handling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Maven (for build management)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## 📌 How to Run
Each project contains its own `README.md` with setup instructions, features, and credentials (if any). Navigate to the respective folder for details.
